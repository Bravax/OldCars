# Simple React Vite & Express fullstack template

 My own minimal fullstack template for personnal projects purposes.
 Feel free to fork and personnalize it at your convenience.
 Special thanks to https://github.com/FlorenceBuchelet/, whose great work on her project "Tamilochi" served as a model for the back-end part.

## Stack

### Frontend :
- React Vite
- SASS
- React Router

### Backend : 
- Express
- Nodemon
- Dotenv
- MySQL2
- Cors

## How to launch
- clone this repo
- in the /front and /back folder: rename the ".env.sample" files ".env" and edit them with your own environment variables
- in the back folder run "npm db:migrate", then run "npm install", then run  "npm run dev"
- in the /front folder run "npm install", then run  "npm run dev"
